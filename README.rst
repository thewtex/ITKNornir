Overview
--------

Nornir takes large sets of overlapping images in 2D and produces registered (a.k.a. aligned) 2D and 3D volumes of any size and scale.

Nornir evolved from a collaboration between the Marc Lab and the Scientific Computing Instituteâ€™s Tasdizen and Whitaker groups at the University of Utah. The original tools, known as the NCR Toolset were used to construct RC1, a 250um diameter, 33um tall cylinder of rabbit retina at a resolution of 2.18 nm/pixel. This package provides Pythonic interfaces to the IR tools, https://www.sci.utah.edu/~koshevoy/research/, as a component of the higher level Nornir Python tools.
